# Coursera
 This is a personal stash of notes made while studying Coursera courses, using Obsidian. For best results you may clone this repository and open it as a vault in Obsidian to view the tags, backlinks, and other things working properly, as GitHub doesn't deal with all that.

 I used codecogs to render the math equations since obsidian's inbuilt LaTeX support doesn't render on github and also doesn't support inline math, which I've used a lot here. Use light mode in obsidian or print as PDF if you want to read it properly (VSCode's preview also works as an alternative).
