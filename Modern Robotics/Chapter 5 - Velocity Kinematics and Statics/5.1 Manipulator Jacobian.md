The tip velocity vtip depends on the coordinates of interest for the tip, which in turn determine the specific form of the Jacobian. For example, in the most general case <img src="https://bit.ly/3uuVVtD" align="center" border="0" alt="v_{tip}" width="24" height="15" /> can be taken to be a six-dimensional twist, while, for pure orienting devices such as a wrist, vtip is usually taken to be the angular velocity of the end-e ector frame. Other choices for vtip lead to different formulations for the Jacobian.
