## 2.1 Degrees of Freedom of a Rigid Body
A rigid body in space has six dofs: one translation and one rotation for each of the X, Y and Z axes. Similarly, a rigid body in a plane has three dofs: X-translation, Y-translation, and rotation about a point in the XY-plane.

 Given a rigid body like a coin for example, you can easily say that the coin has three dofs, along with another 'dof' that tells us if the coin is heads or tails-up. However, you must follow due mathematical process to understand how to translate this trivial observation into math form so we can use it in equations. This understanding will help us dissect more complex bodies later on.

1. Stick an arbitrary coordinate frame <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\{0\}" /> for the XY-plane in which the coin lies. This frame will act as our reference point, and since the space is 'free', it doesn't matter where the reference is put as long as everything in the environment refers to this point, much like a global centre for the environment (let's call it frame {0}). At this point the coin is technically 'free', able to lie in any position/orientation in the plane.
2. Define a point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" /> on the coin, which will have coordinates <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(x_a,y_b)" /> w.r.t the reference frame. Even though <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" /> lies on the coin, we technically still need to define where on the coin the point lies, as the point itself could lie off the centre or even near the edge of the coin. However, since our purpose is to just figure out the dofs of the coin and not it's actual position per se, assume that the point lies on a clearly defined point like the centre.
3. Thus, define another point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> having coordinates <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(x_b,y_b)" /> w.r.t frame <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\{0\}" /> again, that will also lie on the coin, but a certain distance away from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" />. Since again, the only explicit restriction on <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> is the distance from <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" />, the locus that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> makes w.r.t <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" /> is a circle of radius <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?r_{ab}" /> (the distance between <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" />). What this achieves is restricting one of the coordinates of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> to be dependent on the radius, since we can formulate the equation for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> as the equation of a circle.
4. At this point we have three independent variables to take care of: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_a" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y_a" />, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_b" /> (<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y_b" /> is constrained by the circle equation). However, one problem with the circle equation for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> is the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\pm%20x" /> values that can occur due to the square root, which makes its position ambiguous. We can rectify that by using vectors and angles instead: using <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\overrightarrow{AB}" /> as the vector joining <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> (which will be of constant length, courtesy of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?r_{ab}" />), we can use <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\phi_{ab}" /> as the angle that the vector makes with the X-axis of frame <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\{0\}" />.
5. This gives us <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_a" />, <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y_a" />, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_b" /> as our three coordinates that can describe the freedoms of the coin on the plane: <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?x_a" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?y_a" /> will give the position of the coin, and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\phi_{ab}" /> will give the orientation of the coin.
6. However, we still have to figure out the side of the coin (heads or tails), so to do that, define another point <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?C" /> having coordinates <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(x_c,y_c)" /> w.r.t frame <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\{0\}" /> such that it should lie at a distance from both <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> together, i.e it should lie on the circles <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?r_{ab}" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?r_{bc}" /> ( and as centre respectively). The circles must also intersect each other so that there will be two intersection points that will serve as points for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?C" /> to lie on. The presence of these two points will determine whether the coin is heads-up or tails-up. Keep in mind that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?C" /> is being defined relative to <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?A" /> and <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?B" /> at this point, since the two circle intersection points essentially remove any freedom of selection of coordinates for <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?C" /> by giving a discrete choice instead of a normal continuous range of values.

This gives us the configuration of the coin as per the four parameters it contains: 
- XY-coordinates by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?(x_a,y_a)" />
- Orientation by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\phi_{ab}" />
- Heads/tails side by <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?C" />

By specifying these four parameters you can clearly define the position, orientation and side of the coin without issue. The example relied on a core concept used to evaluate dofs of rigid bodies: Find out the total degrees of freedom that the variables you will be using to represent the body are capable of, and the apply constraints on them to reduce redundant degrees of freedom. In our example, the three coordinates we used had six dofs (two XY coordinates per point) but by using radius and angle constraints we reduced the freedoms of the coordinates.

>Note that <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?C" /> doesn't fit the bill of a true 'configuration parameter' since it's not defined across a range of real numbers like the other variables are, so the coin still has three 'true' dof instead of four. This whole logic can be extended to try to define the position of the coin in three-dimensional space too, but that's an exercise for later.

## 2.2 Degrees of Freedom of a Robot
A door is a simple mechanism that opens and closes, moving about a single hinge attached to the wall. Since it has no other motion other than movement around the hinge, we can trivially conclude that the door has one degree of freedom (dof). We can say that the door itself without the hinge would've been lying in free space as a free body, and thus would've been able to have all six dof that a rigid body in free space has. However, the hinge removes five of those dof, leaving the door with only one dof, that of rotation with a variable <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\theta" /> that sets the angle of the door opening.

Thus, the general logic behind calculating dofs for a mechanism is:

<img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\text{dofs%20=%20(Total%20freedoms%20of%20all%20rigid%20bodies)%20-%20(Total%20constraints%20applied%20on%20those%20rigid%20bodies)}" /> 

*This is the fundamental understanding behind Grubler's Equation, which is essential to describing the dofs of complex mechanisms.* It utilises the robot's body parts (links) and the joints connecting them to calculate the constraints placed on the rigid bodies to find the total dof of the entire mechanism.
